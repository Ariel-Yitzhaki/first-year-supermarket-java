# first-year-supermarket-java
My first-year CS assignment is a supermarket simulation in Java. It has classes for Buyer, Seller, Product, ShoppingCart, and Address, plus a Main.java demo showing adding items, handling purchases, and inventory management. A PDF includes UML diagrams and assignment instructions.
Open this project in your IDE (e.g. IntelliJ or Eclipse) and click “Run” on `Main.java`.
